JNB is an experimental file format; the acronym stands for "JSON, Null, Bytes" (this could easily be generalized to Text, Null, Bytes). The basic idea is to create a hybrid file format consisting of a text header, a null terminator and padding, followed by a 16 byte aligned binary data section. The header describes the binary data structure sufficiently so that it can be correctly parsed and validated. This approach makes it easy to inspect the text header on the command line, easy to parse arbitrarily complex metadata from the header, but also provides the density of raw binary storage and the option to mmap the data.
